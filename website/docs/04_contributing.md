# Contributing

We're happy to see that you're interested in contributing, that's great! In the sections below, you can see how to report
bugs or suggest enhancements :rocket:.


## :bug: Reporting bugs

Before creating a bug report, please **search for similar issues to make sure that they're not already reported. If you
don't find any, go ahead and create an issue including as many details as possible.**

> If you find a Closed issue that seems related to the issues that you're experiencing, make sure to reference it in the
> body of your new one by writing its number like this => #42 (Github will auto-link it for you).

Bugs are tracked as GitHub issues. Explain the problem and include additional details to help maintainers reproduce the
problem:

- **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the problem.
- **Describe the exact steps** which reproduce the problem in as many details as possible.
- **Provide specific examples** to demonstrate the steps. Include links to files or GitHub projects, or copy/pasteable
  snippets, which you use in those examples. If you're providing snippets in the issue, use Markdown code blocks.
- **Describe the behavior you observed after following the steps** and point out what exactly is the problem with that
  behavior.
- **Explain which behavior you expected to see** instead and why.
- If the problem is related to performance or memory, **include a CPU profile capture with your report.**

> Remember to label the issue with a "**bug**" tag
