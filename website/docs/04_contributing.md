# Contributing

We're happy to see that you're interested in contributing, that's great! In the sections below, you can see how to report
bugs or suggest enhancements.

If your plan is to create a different package or module using Kotlin (like `llmental-core`), you can duplicate the `.kotlin-template`
folder and rename it to your package name. After that, you'll have to add the package name to the `settings.gradle.kts`
file, in the `includes` list. This way we will keep the same structure for all of them.

## Reporting bugs

Before creating a bug report, please search for similar issues to make sure that they're not already reported. If you
don't find any, go ahead and create an issue including as many details as possible.

> If you find a Closed issue that seems related to the issues that you're experiencing, make sure to reference it in the
> body of your new one by writing its number like this => #42 (Github will autolink it for you).

Bugs are tracked as GitHub issues. Explain the problem and include additional details to help maintainers reproduce the
problem:

- Use a clear and descriptive title for the issue to identify the problem.
- Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem in as many details as possible.
- Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps. Include links to files or GitHub projects, or copy/pasteable
  snippets, which you use in those examples. If you're providing snippets in the issue, use Markdown code blocks.
- Describe the behavior you observed after following the steps and point out what exactly is the problem with that
  behavior.
- Explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why.
- If the problem is related to performance or memory, include a CPU profile capture with your report.
