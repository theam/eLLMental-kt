# Introduction

The eLLMental project raises from the necessity of developer's to have a single framework that joins flexibility,
efficiency and productivity while building the different block an AI application. During this time, we've seen different
challenges that motivated us to start building this project:

1. **Lack of Robust Tools and Libraries:** The field being fairly new means there's a lack of effective tools
   custom-made for LLMs, making it more difficult for developers to understand how LLMs work nowadays.
2. **MLOps management:** There's no one-size-fits-all solution in MLOps and particularly with LLMs, resulting in
   heterogeneity in the tools, platforms, and workflow processes. This means more time is needed to find the right
   stack. Also, evaluating LLMs performance is not straightforward.
3. **Security**: Ensuring the security of the underlying infrastructure, including network security, firewall
   configurations, and container security, is a major challenge. Setting up appropriate monitoring and alerts can be
   both technically challenging and resource-intensive.
4. **Privacy:** LLMs often require large amounts of data, raising potential data privacy issues, which may not be
   adequately addressed by existing MLOps platforms.
5. **Flexibility:** Application's needs grow constantly, and so does AI applications. That's why we are adopting a
   flexible philosophy, by building separate software blocks that con compose themselves into bigger customizable AI
   applications.

Overall, eLLMental is designed to help software engineers build AI-driven applications in an efficient manner by
removing all common headaches while integrating AI in your development environment.
