# Introduction to the usage of components

Welcome to the Components section of the eLLMental library! eLLMental is like a master chef's kitchen, but
instead of preparing food with ingredients, it helps you whip up AI applications with ease through the usage of
well-defined components that work extremely well together.

In eLLMental, components are defined through interfaces. This means that you can easily swap out components for your
own implementations, or even use multiple implementations of the same component in the same application. This allows
you to easily experiment with different components and see which ones work best for your use case.

You write your functions and classes in terms of these components, and then you pass concrete implementations of the
components when you call the functions or instantiate the classes.

<Tabs groupId={TAB_GROUP_ID}>
<TabItem value={PARAMETER_STYLE_VALUE} label={PARAMETER_STYLE_LABEL}>

```kotlin
import com.theagilemonkeys.ellmental.embeddingmodel.*

// Passing it as a parameter to the function
suspend fun doSomething(embeddingModel: EmbeddingModel<Any>): Embedding {
  return embeddingModel.embed("Hello world!")
}

// Passing it as a parameter to the constructor
class MyService(val embeddingModel: EmbeddingModel<Any>) {
  suspend fun doSomething(): Embedding {
    return embeddingModel.embed("Hello world!")
  }
}
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value={CONTEXT_STYLE_VALUE} label={CONTEXT_STYLE_LABEL}>

  [Context Receivers](https://blog.rockthejvm.com/kotlin-context-receivers/) are a Kotlin feature that allows you to express the required dependencies of a function or a class
  through the use of the `context` keyword. This way you can avoid passing the dependencies as parameters, and instead
  let the compiler inject the dependencies for you. This is like dependency injection, but without the need for a
  dependency injection framework.

```kotlin
import com.theagilemonkeys.ellmental.embeddingmodel.*

// Using Context Receivers in a function
context(EmbeddingModel<Any>)
suspend fun doSomething(): Embedding {
  return embed("Hello world!")
}


// Using Context Receivers in a class
context(EmbeddingModel<Any>)
  class MyService {
    suspend fun doSomething(): Embedding {
    return embed("Hello world!")
  }
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Now you can pass your concrete implementations of the components when you call the functions or instantiate the
classes:

<Tabs groupId={TAB_GROUP_ID}>
<TabItem value={PARAMETER_STYLE_VALUE} label={PARAMETER_STYLE_LABEL}>

```kotlin
fun main() = runBlocking {
  // Instantiate the concrete implementation of the EmbeddingModel interface
  val embeddingModel = OpenAIEmbeddingsModel("API KEY")

  // Passing it as a parameter to the function
  doSomething(embeddingModel)

  // Passing it as a parameter to the constructor
  val myService = MyService(embeddingModel)
  myService.doSomething()
}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value={CONTEXT_STYLE_VALUE} label={CONTEXT_STYLE_LABEL}>

```kotlin
fun main() = runBlocking {
  with(OpenAIEmbeddingsModel("API KEY")) {
    // Calling a function
    doSomething()

    // Calling a class method
    val myService = MyService()
    myService.doSomething()
  }
}
```

  Note the difference between the two styles: in the parameter passing style, you pass the concrete implementation as
  a parameter to the function or constructor **manually**. While with the context receivers style, you use the `with`
  once, and then you can call the methods of the component as if they were there in the rest of the application.

# Available components

In this section you will find a list of all the available components in eLLMental, along with a brief description of
what they do and how to use them.

If you want to go to the API documentation of a component, simply click on its name.

## [EmbeddingsModel](api_docs/ellmental/com.theagilemonkeys.ellmental.embeddingsmodel/-embeddings-model/index.md)

The embeddings model is the component that is responsible for generating embeddings from text.

An embedding is a semantic representation of a text in the "semantics space", an imaginary high-dimensional mathematical representation of all the possible semantics. In this space, each concept is associated with a specific point in a way
that words or phrases that are similar from a meaning point of view are placed closer than those with different meanings.
In short, an embedding is an array of numbers representing the text's meaning in the semantics space.

For example, If we were to represent the embeddings of the words `swimming`, `swam`, `walking`, `walked` in a very
simplified visualization, we could see them like this:

<img
  alt="Visualization of word embeddings"
  src={require("./assets/word2vec.png").default}
  style={{
    width: "300px",
  }}/>

Embeddings are useful because they allow you to compare
pieces of text by their _meaning_ rather than by their characters or other properties. For example, the embeddings of
the sentences "I like apples" and "I like oranges" will be very similar, because the vector representation of the
sentences is similar.

The `EmbeddingsModel` interface is defined by the following interface:

```kotlin
interface EmbeddingsModel<Params> {
  suspend fun embed(text: String, params: Params? = null): Embedding
}
```

As you may have noticed, the interface declares a generic parameter that represents possible configuration options for the concrete implementation of the `EmbeddingsModel`. If you're unsure about what to use, you can use `Any` as the generic parameter and then specify it later once you decide on a concrete implementation.

The `EmbeddingsModel` component declares a single `embed` method. This method receives a string that can be a single word, a sentence, a paragraph, or even a whole book, as long as the implementation of the `EmbeddingsModel` that you are using supports processing the length of text that you are passing.

<Tabs groupId={TAB_GROUP_ID}>
<TabItem value={PARAMETER_STYLE_VALUE} label={PARAMETER_STYLE_LABEL}>

```kotlin
import com.theagilemonkeys.ellmental.embeddingmodel.*

suspend fun doSomething(embeddingModel: EmbeddingModel<Any>) {
  val swimmingEmbedding = embeddingModel.embed("swimming")
  println(swimmingEmbedding)
}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value={CONTEXT_STYLE_VALUE} label={CONTEXT_STYLE_LABEL}>

```kotlin
import com.theagilemonkeys.ellmental.embeddingmodel.*

context(EmbeddingModel<Any>)
suspend fun doSomething() {
    val swimmingEmbedding = embed("swimming")
    println(swimmingEmbedding)
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## [VectorStore](api_docs/ellmental/com.theagilemonkeys.ellmental.vectorstore/-vector-store/index.md)

The `VectorStore` component is responsible for storing the embeddings generated by the `EmbeddingsModel` and is defined by the following interface:

```kotlin
interface VectorStore {
  suspend fun upsert(semanticEntry: SemanticEntry)
  suspend fun query(semanticEntry: SemanticEntry, itemsLimit: Int): QueryOutput
}
```

It is important to note that the VectorStore component is not responsible for generating the embeddings. It only stores
and retrieves them.

The `VectorStore` component declares two methods: `upsert` and `query`. The `upsert` method is used to store embeddings in the `VectorStore`, and the `query` method is used to retrieve semantically similar embeddings from the `VectorStore`.

<Tabs groupId={TAB_GROUP_ID}>
<TabItem value={PARAMETER_STYLE_VALUE} label={PARAMETER_STYLE_LABEL}>

```kotlin
import com.theagilemonkeys.ellmental.vectorstore.*

suspend fun doSomething(vectorStore: VectorStore<Any>) {
  val embedding = // some embedding generated by an EmbeddingModel

  vectorStore.upsert(embedding)
  val similarEmbeddings = vectorStore.query(embedding, itemsLimit = 10)
  println(similarEmbeddings)
}
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value={CONTEXT_STYLE_VALUE} label={CONTEXT_STYLE_LABEL}>

```kotlin
import com.theagilemonkeys.ellmental.vectorstore.*

context(VectorStore)
suspend fun doSomething() {
    val embedding = // some embedding generated by an EmbeddingModel

    upsert(embedding)
    val similarEmbeddings = query(embedding)
    println(similarEmbeddings)
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## [SemanticSearch](api_docs/ellmental/com.theagilemonkeys.ellmental.semanticsearch/-semantic-search/index.md)

The `SemanticSearch` component combines the functionality of the `EmbeddingsModel` and the `VectorStore`, abstracting the process of generating embeddings from text and storing them in a VectorStore
to provide a higher-level interface for implementing semantic search use cases. It is defined by the `SemanticSearch` class, which has the following interface:

```kotlin
context(EmbeddingsModel<Any>, VectorStore)
class SemanticSearch {
  suspend fun learn(input: LearnInput)
  suspend fun search(text: String, itemsLimit: Int): SearchOutput
}
```

The `SemanticSearch` component declares two methods: `learn` and `search`. The `learn` method is used to store the semantic meaning of a piece of text, and the `search` method is used to retrieve semantically similar pieces of text.

  println(similarEmbeddings)
}
```

    println(similarEmbeddings)
}
