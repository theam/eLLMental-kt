# Introduction

The eLLMental project was born out of the necessity for developers to have a single toolset that combines flexibility,
efficiency, and productivity while building AI-driven applications. As a team specializing in AI product development,
we've started to find recurrent challenges that motivated us to start building this project:

1. **Lack of Robust Tools and Libraries:** As the field is relatively new, there's a shortage of high-quality production-ready 
tools that help developers to iterate quickly at a certain scale.
2. **MLOps management:** There's no "single click" MLOps solutions that let developers start working on their applications 
in a short period of time without investing a significant amount of time.
3. **Security**: Ensuring minimal security standards of the underlying infrastructure, including network security, 
firewall configurations, and container security, is a major challenge.
4. **Privacy:** Sometimes it's unclear how privacy is handled when using models that are behind an API provided by a 
startup.
5. **Dependency to the Python stack:** Most existing tools were designed by and for data scientists that use Python 
as their default go-to programming language, but most production apps, especially in enterprise, use JVM or .Net based stacks. This not only have an implication on the language used, but also on tooling and configuration management.

Overall, eLLMental is designed to help software engineers efficiently build AI-driven applications by
removing all common headaches while integrating AI into your development environment.
