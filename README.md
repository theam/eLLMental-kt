### Adding a new package

If you feel that you need to create a different package (like `llmental-core`), you can duplicate the `.kotlin-template`
folder and rename it to your package name. After that, you'll have to add the package name to the `settings.gradle.kts`
file, in the `includes` list.

#### Auto-save (Intellij)

Install the [save actions tool](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7642-save-actions) plugin by `Alexandre DuBreuil`
to automatically format the code on save.

Make sure you've configured it like this in your IDE (although it should be already configured because we checked in the
settings file):
