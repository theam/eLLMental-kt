## Quick Start Guide

eLLMental provides composable abstractions for common patterns used in AI applications. For instance, to build a semantic search service with a REST API, using the OpenAI embeddings model and Pinecone as the database, this is what you have to do:

1. Import the eLLMental dependencies in your `build.gradle.kts` file:

```kotlin
allprojects {
    repositories {
        maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
    }
}

dependencies {
    implementation 'com.github.theam:ellmental:main'
}
```

2. Build the API injecting the chosen components as dependencies:

```kotlin
fun main(): Unit = runBlocking {
    with(OpenAI(token = "<OPENAI API KEY>")) {
        with(OpenAIEmbeddingsModel()) {
            with(PineconeVectorStore(apiKey = "<PINECONE API KEY>", url = "<PINECONE API URL>")) {
                with(SemanticSearch()) {
                    this.api.runHttp(port = 8080)
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```
